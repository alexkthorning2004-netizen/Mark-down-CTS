 # Ethical Analysis of Meta Platforms

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has faced significant scrutiny regarding data collection and ad usage practices. The company has been accused and sued for utilizing data without consent, raising ethical concerns about how it runs its apps. For example, during a parliamentary hearing, Meta admitted to using Australian users' posts in 2007 for AI products without the users' consent. The data collected extended from their public profiles and included images of children shared by adults, which were used for Meta's AI models.  

Such actions have ignited debates about user privacy, consent, and the ethical responsibilities of technology companies in handling personal data.  
Meta is constantly being watched and criticized for what they do with people's data and how they collect it.  
Their collection has led to advancements in AI and personalized user experiences. But, these benefits hide the negative consequences, such as user trust, potential misuse of personal information, and legal issues.  
In 2018, Meta was fined 251 million euros by the European Union privacy watchdogs after an investigation into data breaches exposed millions of people's accounts in Europe.  

Meta’s practices prioritize profit even at the expense of user privacy, which can lead to potential harm.  
The textbook highlights that **"the distribution of benefits and harms to all stakeholders"** must be considered when looking at corporate decisions.  
Deontology looks at outdated principles, as mentioned in the textbook.  
Meta's ways of running their apps contradict ethical standards and morality in protecting their user's privacy.  
**"moral guidelines acceptable to society such as honesty, fairness, and justice."**  
How Meta prioritizes profit over their users' privacy shows a lack of integrity.  
In the textbook, the authors discuss that **"integrity refers to the appropriateness of a corporation’s behaviour and its adherence to moral guidelines."**  

Care ethics is how relationships and responsibility are displayed in business ethics.  
Meta's lack of care for user privacy crosses the boundaries of its ethical duty to protect its users.  
Care Ethics stresses relationships and responsibility.  
Meta’s disregard for user privacy violates the ethical duty to protect vulnerable individuals, echoing the textbook’s notion that ethical decision-making should include **"managing relationships with stakeholders."**  

Addressing these issues is important for users' data protection and policies around data collection.  
Meta needs to prioritize its users instead of extorting them for profit.  
When a company takes this approach, it must come at it ethically, as the textbook states, **"moral responsibilities when making decisions."**  
The authors state that this is important when practicing fair corporate behaviour.  

The ethical evaluation that looks at the consequences of Metadata practices is wide.  
Meta says that their data collection is being used to improve their AI technologies and personalize user experiences.  
The long-term consequences of these practices outweigh the short-term benefits of profit.  
The 2018 EU fine is a great example of the harm being done to users and how their private data is being exposed.  
According to the report by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), data breaches done by Meta undermine privacy rights.  
**"Privacy is a fundamental right and must be safeguarded."**  
Meta has suffered the consequences of prioritizing profit over privacy, and Meta’s users will continue to be informed that their data has been breached.  
They will feel betrayed and less inclined to trust using their platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, which are many people's important tools in their day-to-day lives.  

When examining Meta's way of business through a deontological lens, we can focus on the ethical duties and principles that Meta has disregarded.  
Deontology suggests that actions are morally right or wrong based on rules and principles rather than outcomes.  
Meta and its data collection methods violate many core values of fairness, justice, and honesty.  
It also goes against traditional ethical theories such as Immanuel Kant’s concept of treating individuals as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end.  

This applies to Meta's use of data for user data for AI models without consent.  
The company's actions also contradict the morality of protecting their users' data, a key principle practised in corporate ethics.  
As discussed in Reform UK tracked private user information without consent,  
**"Data gathered by the Meta pixel enters the firm’s advertising system and can be used for Meta’s purposes as well as by advertisers such as Reform to re-target audiences with tailored ads."**  

Another important ideology is virtue and ethics, which focuses on the character and moral traits of the decision-makers.  
This lens allows us to examine Meta and how their executives lack morals.  
Virtue in terms of integrity and honesty.  
**“Data is a form of power, and with this power comes the responsibility to use it ethically.”**  
In the context of virtue and ethics, a company like Meta has failed to consider the impact of how they collect and use their user’s data,  
**“data is a form of power, and with this power comes the responsibility to use it ethically.”**  

According to virtue and ethics, a business such as Meta is expected to make an effort to value its users' privacy.  
However, its actions have shown that these known business practices are neglected in favour of maximizing the company's profit.  
Meta's next steps should be to ensure the safety of its users’ data, which is essential to preserving its relationship with its users.  

In conclusion, Meta's approach to data collection has raised concerns about ethics that go beyond a legal standpoint and moral responsibility.  
In this paper, we have viewed Meta from a consequentialist perspective, which shows that the long-term harms outweigh the immediate benefits.  
From a deontological perspective, Meta does not respect their users’ privacy and lacks moral integrity.  
To address these concerns, Meta has to change its data collection processes to ensure privacy for its users.  
Stakeholders and decision-makers must bring in more ethical standpoints when making decisions for the company, aligning their practices with moral guidelines and embracing transparency, fairness, and honesty to restore user trust.
